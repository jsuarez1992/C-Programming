In this exercise we will create a dictionary so, that it can read words from a file and write words to a file. The dictionary must also be able to translate both from one to another language and back (in this exercise we ignore the fact that some words might be written the same in Finnish and in other languages). Your mission is to create a dictionary in the class **SaveableDictionary**.
