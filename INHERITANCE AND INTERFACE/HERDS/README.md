In this exercise we are going to create organisms and herds of organisms that can move around. To represent the locations of the organisms we'll use a two-dimensional coordinate system. Each position involves two numbers: x and y coordinates. The x coordinate indicates how far from the (i.e. point zero, where x = 0, y = 0) that position is horizontally. The y coordinate indicates the distance from the origin vertically.
