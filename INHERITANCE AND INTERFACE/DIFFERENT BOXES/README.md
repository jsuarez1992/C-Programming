In the exercise template you'll find the classes **Item** and **Box**. *Box is an abstract class*, where adding multiple items is implemented by repeatedly calling the Add-method. The Add-method, meant for adding a single item, is abstract, so every class that inherits it, must implement it. Your assignment is to edit the Box-class and to implement different kinds of boxes based on the Box class.
